# EncryptedNAS

EncryptedNAS is a utility which enables files to be stored and organized in encrypted archives. It supports adding search tags to the encrypted files to facilitate searching and sorting files. It includes a companion application which can be used to view media stored in these archives, search for files and manage the files' tags. This application can be run standalone or as a [Sessen](https://github.com/ElizabethF2/Sessen) extension. EncryptedNAS can be used on top of any storage device but is primarily designed for use with [ReflectiveNAS](https://github.com/ElizabethF2/ReflectiveNAS).
